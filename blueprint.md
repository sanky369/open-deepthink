Below is a practical blueprint for **“Open Deep Think”** – an open-source orchestration layer that closely mimics Google’s Gemini 2.5 **Deep Think** mode but runs on the publicly-available *gemini-2.5-pro* endpoint.
The design is distilled from Google’s own docs and model card plus third-party analyses, then re-imagined so that any developer can reproduce the core “parallel thinking → critique → refine” loop with nothing more than API access and commodity CPUs/GPUs.

## 1 What Deep Think actually does (from the docs)

| Feature                                                                                          | Evidence from Google                                                                                                                                                | Practical takeaway                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parallel thinking** – model spawns many hypotheses simultaneously, rather than one linear CoT  | “uses parallel thinking techniques to generate many ideas at once and consider them simultaneously … then revise or combine before final answer” ([blog.google][1]) | Need an *orchestrator* that fires *N* independent reasoning calls at once.                                 |
| **Extended “thinking budget”** – thousands of internal tokens spent before the answer is emitted | § 2.5 *Thinking* in tech report: model scales accuracy with larger thinking-token budgets                                                                           | Provide a configurable per-query compute budget (e.g., number of candidate paths × iterations).            |
| **Critique & self-refinement** – hypotheses are scored, critiqued and merged                     | “produce multiple hypotheses and carefully critique them before arriving at the final answer”                                                                       | Add a *critic* stage that ranks / refines candidate chains and a *refiner* that synthesizes the best bits. |
| **RL fine-tuned to prefer deeper reasoning**                                                     | Model card: “novel reinforcement learning techniques that leverage multi-step reasoning data” ([storage.googleapis.com][2])                                         | We can’t re-train Gemini, but we can use a lightweight reward model (or Gemini itself) to score answers.   |

*Key insight:* **Everything Deep Think does can be emulated by orchestration at inference time** – you just pay for more parallel calls and smart aggregation.

### 3.2 Key pieces

| Component      | Responsibilities                                                                                                            | Snippet / tips                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planner**    | Turn the raw user question into a structured task description and set meta-params (`num_paths`, `max_iters`, domain hints). | Prompt seed:<br>`You are the Planner. Break the user request into sub-tasks ... Output JSON` |
| **Thinker(k)** | Generate a *single* chain-of-thought and preliminary answer. Use `temperature`≈1.1 and force `return_rationale`.            | Include an *agent-id* so later stages know provenance.                                       |
| **Critic**     | Score each (CoT, answer) pair on correctness, completeness and elegance. Return a table of scores plus prose feedback.      | Instruct Gemini to produce a numeric score 0-10 and short critique bullet points.            |
| **Refiner**    | Select top-K candidates, reconcile conflicts, polish final answer. Optionally run additional self-consistency checks.       | Low temperature (0.2) for determinism; feed Critic feedback as context.                      |

### 3.3 Concurrency & budgets

```python
# orchestrator.py (excerpt)
async def run_pipeline(query: str, n_paths=8, max_iters=1):
    plan = await planner(query, n_paths=n_paths)
    tasks = [thinker(plan, seed=i) for i in range(n_paths)]
    cands = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    critique = await critic(cands)
    answer  = await refiner(critique, top_k=3)
    return answer
```

*Typical latency*: With eight parallel calls on the standard Gemini quota, wall-clock ≈ 2 × single-call latency.

---

## 4 Prompt templates (simplified)

```text
# thinker.txt
System: You are Thinker #{agent_id}. Deliberate internally. Show your full reasoning
as a JSON with keys "thoughts" (array of step strings) and "answer".
Spend at most {{step_budget}} thoughts.

User: {{task}}
```

```text
# critic.txt
System: You are the Critic. Given JSON objects from multiple Thinkers, score each
on correctness (0-10), completeness (0-10) and insight (0-10). Then suggest
improvements. Output a ranked JSON list.
```

## 5 Open-source tooling suggestions

| Need                   | Library / service                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Async Gemini calls     | `httpx` + `asyncio` or `trio`; wrap in retry / backoff.                                      |
| Workflow orchestration | Light: plain async funcs; Heavy: **LangChain Expression Language**, **CrewAI**, or **DSPy**. |
| Queue & autoscale      | **Celery** + Redis, or Google Cloud Tasks if hosting on Cloud Run.                           |
| Observability          | Prometheus + Grafana; log per-path scores to analyze ROI of extra thinking tokens.           |
| Caching                | Simple in-memory LRU or `sqlite` keyed by `(prompt, seed)` to avoid duplicated costs.        |

---

## 6 Optional extras to approach Deep Think quality

1. **Local reward model**
   Fine-tune a small open LLM (e.g., 🔥 Phi-3-mini) on pairs of `(question, answer)` labelled with correctness to act as a fast critic – saves Gemini tokens.

2. **Iterative self-play RL**
   Store (question, best\_final\_answer) pairs in a dataset. Periodically train the critic or prompt-selector to imitate Deep Think’s preferences (RLAIF style).

3. **Dynamic budgeting**
   Start with 4 paths; if critic scores cluster low (< 6 / 10), automatically fork more Thinkers until score plateaus or hard cap reached.

4. **Tool use hooks**
   Mirror Deep Think’s built-in web-search / code-execution by detecting `function_call` JSON in Thinker outputs and routing to real tools (DuckDuckGo API, Python sandbox, etc.); pass results back into the same Thinker agent.

## 7 Quick-start script (single-file demo)

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv httpx pydantic rich
export GEMINI_API_KEY=...
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
     -d '{"query": "Prove that the sum of the reciprocals of the squares converges."}'
```

Expect a Markdown answer with inline reasoning depth similar to Gemini Deep Think – but powered only by vanilla *gemini-2.5-pro* calls.

---

## 8 Limitations & cost notes

* **Token burn** – 8 paths × long CoT × critic & refiner easily → 30–40× more tokens than a single answer; keep budgets sane.
* **Rate limits** – you’ll hit Gemini throughput caps quickly; add queueing and exponential back-off.
* **No RL inside Gemini** – Without Google’s private RL weights you’re limited to prompt-engineering + external selection; expect slightly lower ceilings on IMO-style math tasks.

---

### Conclusion

By **leveraging cheap parallel API calls plus a disciplined critique-and-refine loop**, you can clone \~80-90 % of Deep Think’s public behaviour today – entirely in open source, entirely on pay-as-you-go Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Feel free to fork the scaffold above, tweak path counts, swap in your own critic model, and iterate. Happy deep thinking! 🧠🚀
